Illustrates an error in [@types/passport-local-mongoose](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/passport-local-mongoose) that's outlined in this [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67726174/passport-local-mongoose-serializeuser-incorrect-type) bug. [passport.serializeUser()](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/cdf1d8ac3e92e6d596ee95d8a0b0aa5ebe7a0d8d/types/passport/index.d.ts#L84) expects the callback to take an `Express.User` object as the first parameter but `@types/passport-local-mongoose` defines [@types/passport-local-mongoose](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/cdf1d8ac3e92e6d596ee95d8a0b0aa5ebe7a0d8d/types/passport-local-mongoose/index.d.ts#L38) as taking a `PassportLocalModel` as the first argument.
